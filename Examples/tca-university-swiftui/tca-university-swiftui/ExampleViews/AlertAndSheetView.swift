        This demonstrates how to work with alerts and action sheets in the VERSE.

        Because the library demands that all data flow through the application in a single direction, we \
        cannot use SwiftUI's two-way bindings because they can make changes to state without going through a reducer. \
        This means we can't directly use the standard API to display alerts and sheets.

        The library comes with two types, `AlertState` and `ActionSheetState`, which can be constructed from reducers \
        and control whether or not an alert or action sheet is displayed. Further, it automatically handles sending actions \
        when you tap their buttons, which allows you to properly handle their functionality in the reducer \
        rather than in two-way bindings and action closures.

        The benefit of doing this is that you can get full test coverage on how a user interacts with alerts and action sheets in your application
